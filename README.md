## ✨ Features

* **Classic Gameplay** — Eat food, grow longer, don’t crash.
* **Dynamic Spawns** — Randomized food and **bombs** (instant game over).
* **Robust Collisions** — Walls, self, and bomb detection.
* **Juicy Audio** — Bite, bomb, and game-over sounds (with toggle).
* **Responsive UI** — Scales nicely across devices.
* **(Optional)** High score saved with `localStorage`.

---

## 🎮 Controls

**Keyboard (Desktop)**

* `↑/↓/←/→` or `W/A/S/D` — Move
* `Space` — Pause / Resume
* `M` — Mute / Unmute

**Touch (Mobile)**

* On-screen arrows / swipe (if enabled button)

---

## 🧠 Rules

* Eating food **+1 length** and **+score**.
* Hitting a **wall**, **yourself**, or a **bomb** ends the game.
* Speed may increase progressively (if enabled).

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Clone
git clone https://github.com/prashik24/SnakeGame.git

# 2) Enter folder
cd SnakeGame

# 3) Play
# Option A: Open index.html in your browser
# Option B (recommended): run a static server for correct audio/asset loading
#   - VS Code: install "Live Server" → Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"
#   - Or using Python:
python -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

> If your project lives elsewhere, replace the clone URL accordingly.

## ⚙️ Configuration (optional)

You can expose simple tweakables in a `config` object (speed, grid size, bomb rate, sound enabled by default), e.g.:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  gridSize: 20,
  tickMs: 120,
  bombChance: 0.05,
  wrapAround: false,   // set true to allow going through walls
  soundEnabled: true
};
```

## 🧪 Development Tips

* Use a local server to avoid asset loading issues (audio/images).
* Keep update/draw cycles separate for readability.
* Debounce direction changes to prevent 180° turns in one tick.

---

## ❗ Troubleshooting

* **No sound?**
  Most browsers block autoplay. Interact (click/tap) once or toggle sound with **M**.
* **Black canvas or nothing happens?**
  Open via a local server (see Quick Start). Direct file URLs can block assets.
* **Controls feel laggy?**
  Close background tabs, reduce `tickMs`, or lower grid size.
