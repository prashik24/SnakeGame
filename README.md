Here’s a crisper, more polished README you can drop in. I kept your voice, tightened the copy, and added sections devs/users usually look for (controls, rules, file structure, troubleshooting, and a mini-roadmap). Swap the repo links if needed.

## ⚙️ Configuration (optional)

You can expose simple tweakables in a `config` object (speed, grid size, bomb rate, sound enabled by default), e.g.:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  gridSize: 20,
  tickMs: 120,
  bombChance: 0.05,
  wrapAround: false,   // set true to allow going through walls
  soundEnabled: true
};
```

## 🧪 Development Tips

* Use a local server to avoid asset loading issues (audio/images).
* Keep update/draw cycles separate for readability.
* Debounce direction changes to prevent 180° turns in one tick.
